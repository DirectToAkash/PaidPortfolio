Refund Policy – PaidPortfolio

Last Updated: [Add Date]

Thank you for purchasing from PaidPortfolio. We sell digital portfolio products and related services. Because our products are digital and often delivered instantly or custom-prepared, our refund policy is limited and applies only under specific conditions described below.

1. General Policy

All purchases made on PaidPortfolio are considered final and non-refundable, except in situations where we are unable to fully deliver the purchased product or there is a verified issue with the final delivery.

By making a purchase, you agree to this refund policy.

2. When a Refund May Be Provided

A refund will only be considered in the following cases:

✅ A. Non-Delivery of Product

If we are unable to deliver the product completely due to a technical issue, system failure, or an internal error from our side, you may be eligible for a full or partial refund.

✅ B. Major Issue with Final Delivery

If the final delivered product has a serious functional or technical issue that:
	•	Prevents you from accessing or using the portfolio, and
	•	Cannot be resolved by our support team within a reasonable time

then you may qualify for a refund.

We reserve the right to first attempt to fix, replace, or re-deliver the product before issuing a refund.

3. Situations Where Refunds Will NOT Be Provided

Refunds will not be issued in the following cases:
	•	You changed your mind after purchase
	•	You no longer need the portfolio
	•	You expected additional features not listed on the product page
	•	You lack the technical knowledge to use the portfolio
	•	Minor design preferences (colors, layout style, fonts, etc.)
	•	Delay in response from your side during custom delivery process
	•	Downloaded or delivered files have already been accessed successfully

Because our products are digital and non-returnable, we cannot accept returns once delivery is completed successfully.

4. Custom or Personalized Portfolios

For custom-built or personalized portfolio services:
	•	Work already completed is non-refundable
	•	If a project is canceled midway, only the undelivered portion (if any) may be considered for partial refund — solely at our discretion

5. Refund Request Process

To request a refund, you must contact us within 7 days of delivery at:

Email: [your support email]
Include:
	•	Your order number
	•	Description of the issue
	•	Screenshots or proof (if applicable)

Our team will review your request and respond within 3–5 business days.

6. Chargebacks & Disputes

Initiating a chargeback without contacting us first may result in:
	•	Suspension of services
	•	Permanent restriction from future purchases
	•	Submission of proof of delivery to the payment provider

We encourage you to contact us first so we can resolve the issue quickly.

7. Policy Updates

PaidPortfolio reserves the right to update or modify this refund policy at any time without prior notice. Continued use of our services means you accept the updated policy.
